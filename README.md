How to Run the Application ?
Prerequisites
Based on your initial note, make sure you have the following installed before running the application:

Java (JDK): Required to compile and run the Spring Boot application.

MySQL: The application likely uses a MySQL database, which must be installed and running (and configured correctly within the application) for it to function properly.



You can start the Spring Boot application from the directory where the project is located 
(e.g., /Users/apple/Desktop/Student).

Use one of the following commands:

Using the Maven Wrapper:

**Bash**

./mvnw spring-boot:run



Using Maven (if installed globally):

**Bash**

mvn spring-boot:run
Once started, the application will be listening on:  http://localhost:8080
